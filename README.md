# LinkCheckerWithAJAX Lab

In this lab, you will modify a simple link checking app to use ajax. The basic functionality is a site that allows the user to enter a url.  The site will make a get request on the url and save the http response code.

## Objectives

* Make all of the tests pass (both rails and jasmine)
* Get practice using jQuery.post


## Instructions

* The user should never have to refresh the page
	* Make the root route the index action.
	* The user should be able to submit a new site from the index.  This should be handled using an ajax post.
	* The input and button for submitting a new site should be added dynamically in javascript
	* The result of create should be appended to the end of the table
* Make sure you seed your database.  That should give you some sample data to work with.

## Hints

* To add newly created sites to the page, first find the table element using $('#siteTable'), then use ```.append("<h1>Some HTML</h1>")```


## Bonus

Add a delete button that issues an http delete on a specific row.  This action also requires an auth token.

## Extra Bonus (Difficult)

Add a shuffle button that will remove all the table rows from the table, make an http GET to refresh the list of sites, then repopulate the table in a random order.  This is difficult.
